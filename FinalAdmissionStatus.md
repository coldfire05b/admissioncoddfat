Hi,

We are grateful for the time you spent on your application to CodePath. However, we regret to inform you that we cannot process your application due to the following reason/s:

- ***(put admission status here)*** 

We understand that you have put a lot of effort on the application process. Our courses are restricted to students currently enrolled in our partner universities within the United States based on the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization. Large numbers of talented individuals like you apply every year and scenarios like this break our hearts.

We encourage you to continually check our resources page to learn more and sign up for our mailing list for our future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in. You may also check our interview guide containing tips and guidelines that you might find helpful.
