Hi,

Thank you for getting in touch regarding the status of your application. 

We do understand your concern that it really took some time to give you an update since the process for admission usually takes 3 - 4 weeks. Based on our records, your Tech Fellow admission status is:

- ***[put admission status here]***
  - *[elaborate details here]*

CodePath will be sending updates every week after completion of application so we encourage everyone to check their emails regularly. We hope that we have answered your inquiry and if you have any other concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us anytime. Have a nice day!

Best regards,

*Michael Carl*
